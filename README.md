# Simple Shell Project

This project implements a simple UNIX command line interpreter, also known as a shell.

The shell supports basic functionality such as executing commands, handling errors, and providing an interactive prompt for user input.

## Task 0: Betty would be proud

Ensure that the code follows the Betty coding style by running the `betty_check.sh` script.

## Task 1: Simple shell 0.1

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:
- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- Handle the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
- You don’t have to use the PATH or implement built-ins.

## Task 2: Simple shell 0.2

Handle command lines with arguments.

## Task 3: Simple shell 0.3

Handle the PATH. Fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist.

## Task 4: Simple shell 0.4

Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.

Usage: exit

## Task 5: Simple shell 1.0

Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
